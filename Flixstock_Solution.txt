The dataset includes 4-d images. To fit the targeted imagenet, the images were resized to (224, 224)
and were normalized such that the intensity ranged between 0 to 1. After that, the images were
converted to the proper datatype.
	The solution incorporates a pre-trained resnet50 that generates a feature map. The input layer
of the model was adapted to accomodate a 4-channel input instead of the default 3-channel input.
The feature map was generated for all the images within the dataset. After feature map generation
the annoy package was used index the feature map and compute the cosine similarity between them.
	Finally, the "solution" class was created to take the image as an input. It automatically
applies all the aforementioned transformations, generates the feature map, adds the image to the
index, computes the distance and outputs 10 similar garments.
	To use the "solution" class, it is required to input a URI of the image that is to be used as 
the input. That image can then be sent to create an object of the solution class and with that, the
"plot_sim" function can be used to get the output.
